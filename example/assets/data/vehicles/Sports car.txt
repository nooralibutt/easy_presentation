The Sports Car is probably the best looking vehicle in the game – and also the fastest. It can carry up to 2 players. Overall, this car is one of the top choices you could get in a solo match – it unrivaled speed could help you rotate to literally anywhere on the map without fail. The fact that it can reach top speed faster would also increase the damage it deals when you crash into people.
